## About

AI Watermark is a cutting-edge technology that visually represents the confidence and truthfulness of AI-generated content. Based on Ucaretron Inc.'s patented technology, this system provides intuitive visual cues to help users distinguish between high-confidence AI inferences and potentially unreliable content.

## 🌟 Features

### 🔍 Visual Confidence Indicators
- **Color-coded text**: Different colors represent varying confidence levels
  - 🟦 Blue: High confidence inference (>80%)
  - ⬛ Black: Standard confidence inference
  - 🟥 Red: Low confidence or potentially unreliable inference (<50%)

### 📊 Multi-format Support
- **Text documents**: Font variations, underlining, and color-coding
- **Images**: Pixel-level identification of AI-generated content
- **Audio**: Tonal and frequency variations to mark confidence levels
- **Video**: Frame-by-frame watermarking and color histogram modifications

### 🔄 Integration Options
- API for real-time watermarking of AI outputs
- Post-processing tools for existing content
- Verification systems to detect and interpret watermarks

## 💡 Why AI Watermarking Matters

As generative AI becomes increasingly sophisticated, distinguishing between AI-generated content and authentic human-created content grows more challenging. More importantly, even within AI-generated content, the confidence levels can vary significantly.

Our watermarking technology provides:
- Transparency about AI's confidence in its own outputs
- Easy visual identification of potentially unreliable content
- Protection against misinformation and AI hallucinations
- Trust building in AI-human interactions

## 🛠️ Implementation Methods

### Text Watermarking
```
In conclusion, electrochemical enzymeless sensors have shown great potential in various applications,
especially in the detection of hazardous gases and biomolecules. With further research and
development, these sensors can become an important tool for sensing and monitoring in various fields.

*Black text represents high-confidence AI inferences*

```
These sensors have also been used in the detection of biomolecules, such as glucose
and cholesterol, and in environmental monitoring.
```
*Red text (or underlined) represents lower-confidence inferences*

### Image Watermarking
- Subtle pixel-level modifications to mark AI-generated regions
- Color intensity variations based on confidence levels
- Invisible watermarks detectable through specialized tools

### Audio & Video Watermarking
- Frequency and tonal modifications for confidence indicators in audio
- Frame-specific markings and color histogram alterations in video
- Metadata embedding for machine-readable confidence data
- Generation of sample audio data with configurable waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth, noise), frequency, and duration for testing and demonstration (see `examples/example_usage.py`).
- A command-line tool (`compare_audio.py`) for detailed comparison of original and watermarked audio files, including frequency analysis summaries and playback functionality.
